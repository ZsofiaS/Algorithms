# Algorithms

This is a project to validate my understanding of algorithmic complexity, and coding while learning the topics.

### Selection sort

Selection sort is the simplest sorting algorithm.  
The time complexity is O(nÂ²) as we are searching over a list (O(n)), and we have to do this n times, for every element on the list.

[Here](https://github.com/ZsofiaS/SelectionSort.git) is the Javascript code for a selection sort, TDD-d with Jasmine.

### Quicksort

Quicksort is a sorting algorithm.
The time complexity is O(nlogn) in average case, and O(n2) in worst case scenario. This depends on the pivot chosen.

[Here](https://github.com/ZsofiaS/Quicksort.git) is the Javascript code for a quicksort, TDD-d with Jasmine.

### Breadth-first search

[Here](https://github.com/ZsofiaS/Algorithms/tree/master/breadthFirstSearch) is the Javascript code for a breadth-first search, TDD-d with Jasmine.
